# Make Client Self Service Portal (Lite) for Finance Ops
# Problem Statement
In the current financial services landscape, providing customers with access to their personal financial data (such as account balances, transaction history, and statements) is often a manual and inefficient process.

The core issues include:
Manual Dependencies: Clients have to email or call the Finance Operations team to get simple information.
Operational Bottlenecks: The finance team spends valuable time generating routine reports instead of focusing on complex tasks.
Client Delays:Customers face significant waiting times to access their own data, leading to a poor user experience and lack of transparency.

There is a critical need for a streamlined, digital interface that removes these manual barriers.


#  The Solution
This project aims to build a Client Self-Service Portal (Lite)—a secure, web-based application designed to empower clients with direct, 24/7 access to their financial information.

Our approach focuses on:
1.  Automation: Replacing manual data requests with automated database queries.
2.  Self-Service: allowing clients to log in and retrieve their data instantly without human intervention.
3.  Security: Implementing robust authentication to ensure financial data remains private and secure.

By bridging the gap between the backend financial data and the end-user via a simple web interface, this solution reduces the workload on the operations team and enhances client satisfaction.



# Key Features
